A home automation system typically connects controlled devices to a central smart home hub. The user

interface for control of the system uses a mobile phone application. Bluetooth Controlled Electronic

Home Appliances is a simple project, where we can control diꢀerent electrical appliances and electronic

devices using an Android device with the help of Bluetooth Technology.

By following this guide, you will be able to know and make your smart extension board. This project

guide contains the ꢁles necessary to help you step by step produce your own Smart Extension Board.

Please follow the steps of the project to get a positive result.

Users should install an Android application in the user’s mobile to control the electrical loads. Using this

Android application users can send the commands to the Bluetooth module to control the electrical

loads. Bluetooth is used in this project... It can also be called a“Smart Extension Board”or“Android-based

Home Automation System"

**Step 1: Get Your PCB Ready!**

**Talking About Electronics**

After making the circuit diagram I transformed it into a PCB design to produce it, to produce the PCB, I

have chosen [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/IAT)[ ](https://jlcpcb.com/IAT)the best PCB supplier and the cheapest PCB provider to order my circuit. with the

reliable platform, all I need to do is some simple clicks to upload the Gerber ꢁle and set some parameters

like the PCB thickness color and quantity. I’ve paid just 2 Dollars to get my PCB after ꢁve days only, what I

have noticed about [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/IAT)[ ](https://jlcpcb.com/IAT)this time is the "out-of-charge **PCB color**" which means you will pay only 2

USD for any PCB color you choose.

As you can see in the pictures above the PCB is very well manufactured and I’ve got the same PCB design

that we’ve made for our main board and all the labels and logos are there to guide me during the

soldering steps. You can also download the Gerber ꢁle for this circuit from the download link below in

case you want to place an order for the same circuit design.

**Step 4: After Soldering All the Components to PCB, Connect Arduino Nano to Your**

**PC(use Arduino IDE) / Phone(use ArduinoDroid) and Upload the Code.**

**Step 5: Download Arduino Bluetooth Controller From Play Store.**

Turn ON the Bluetooth, pair the HC-05 Bluetooth module to the phone(usually the password is "1234" for

the HC-05 Bluetooth module).

After pairing the Bluetooth module open the Arduino Bluetooth control app and connect HC-05.

Tap on the button icon, then tap on Button 1 and change the button name and ("ON"-"OFF")Command as

shown in the images below.

**Step 6: Connection of Relay & Extention Board**

Connect both wires of **Switch 1** of the **Extension board** to the **screw terminal** of **Relay 1** on the PCB.

Do the same connection for **Switch 2, 3 & 4**(i.e. Connect both wires of **Switch 2,3 & 4** to the **screw**

**terminal** of **Relay 2,3 & 4** respectively on the PCB )

Make sure to connect the **power cable for Arduino** before closing the extension board.

Close the cover of the extension board and done!

**Step 7: Final Step**

Power the Arduino with any adapter or power bank, also power the extension board.

**Connect the HC-05** with the **Arduino Bluetooth control app** and now turn on **the electrical appliance**

**with the help of the app wirelessly** or even from the **Physical Switch itself!**
